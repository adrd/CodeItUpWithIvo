Open Judge System (OJS)
===========
OJS (Open Judge System) is an open source system for online algorithm competitions.
The algorithm competitions are timed contests where all contestants compete online and are given the same algorithmic problems to solve under the same time and memory constraints.
The competitions are currently available in six programming languages: C#, C++, JavaScript, Java, PHP and Python. 
The system consists of few parts:
* Web interface for users and administrators (ASP.NET MVC)
* Windows service for compiling, executing and checking user submissions
* Restricted process executor using Windows APIs
* Compiler wrappers and checkers
